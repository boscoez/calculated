----------CALCULATOR HELP----------

This Calculator is a command-line tool for evaluating mathematical expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
Below is a summary of its functionality and usage:

1. How to Input Expressions:
- You can input mathematical expressions using a combination of numbers, operators, and functions.

2. Supported Operators:
- The following operators are supported:

   + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), ^ (exponentiation), sqrt (square root),
   sin (sine), cos (cosine), tan (tangent), cot (cotangent), arcsin (arcsine), arccos (arccosine),
   arctan (arctangent), arcctg (arccotangent), ln (natural logarithm), and log (logarithm base 10).

3. Usage:
- To use the calculator, follow these steps:
- Select "1" or "compute" from the menu to start computation.
- Enter your RPN expression when prompted.
- The calculator will evaluate the expression and display the result.

4. Supported Parentheses, Braces, and Brackets:
- You can use parentheses "(", ")", "{", "}", "[", and "]" to group parts of your expression.
- The calculator ensures that parentheses are properly balanced.

5. Special Commands:
- You can use "2" For "help" to display this help menu.
- To exit the calculator, choose "3" or "exit" from the menu.

6. Notes:
- Invalid expressions or division by zero will result in appropriate error messages.
- The calculator provides options for various mathematical functions and operations.
- This calculator is capable of reading in expressions normally: 5+8, 10*(3+2), 10^7,
or in Reverse Polish Notation RPN 10 3 2 + .

 - See example expressions.

Example Expressions:
- To calculate the square root of 16: "16 sqrt"
- To calculate 5 + 3: "5 3 +"
- To calculate 10 * (3 + 2): "10 3 2 + *"
- To calculate -5.78+-(4-2.23)+sin(0)*cos(1)/(1+tan(2*ln(-3+2*(1.23+99.111))))
- For more complex expressions, use operators and grouping as needed.
